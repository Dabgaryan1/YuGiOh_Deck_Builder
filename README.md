# YuGiOh_Deck_Builder
This is my first project built with FastAPI. It allows anyone to build their own Yu-Gi-Oh decks online. The goal of this project is to practice full-stack backend development using FastAPI, and eventually extend it with authentication, database persistence, and a frontend interface.
